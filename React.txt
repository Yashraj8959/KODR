preventDefault() --> it prevents default behavior of any tag


useEffect()---------------------------------------------------->

What is useEffect?

Imagine useEffect as a special side effect hook in React.
Side effects are actions that go beyond simply rendering the component. They can involve:
Fetching data from an API
Setting up subscriptions (like listening for events)
Manipulating the DOM directly (though this should generally be avoided)
Logging something to the console
How does useEffect work?

Triggers: useEffect runs after the component renders on the screen.
Cleanup: If you return a function within useEffect, that function will be called before the component re-renders. This is crucial for cleaning up things like subscriptions or event listeners to prevent memory leaks.
Example:

JavaScript

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    // This effect will run after the component renders 
    // and whenever the 'count' state changes
    console.log('Count has changed:', count);

    // Cleanup function: This will run before the next render
    return () => {
      console.log('Cleaning up...'); 
    };
  }, [count]); // <-- This dependency array is important!

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
Key Points:

Dependency Array: The second argument to useEffect is an array.
If the array is empty ([]), the effect will run only once after the initial render.
If the array includes a value (like [count] in the example), the effect will run again whenever that value changes.
In simpler terms:

useEffect helps you manage side effects that happen alongside your component's rendering.
It lets you do things like fetch data, subscribe to events, and clean up after yourself.
The dependency array controls when the effect should re-run.




Props in React-------------------------------------------->

What are Props?

Props (short for "properties") are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component in React.
Think of them as the "ingredients" that a child component needs to function.
How do they work?

When you create a child component, you can define what props it expects to receive.
In the parent component, you pass the necessary data as attributes to the child component.
Example:

JavaScript

// Child Component (MyButton.js)
function MyButton({ label, onClick }) { 
  return (
    <button onClick={onClick}>{label}</button>
  );
}

// Parent Component (App.js)
function App() {
  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log("Button clicked!");
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <MyButton label="Click Me" onClick={handleClick} /> 
    </div>
  );
}
In this example:

MyButton component expects two props: label (the text on the button) and onClick (a function to be called when the button is clicked).
App component passes the label as "Click Me" and the handleClick function as the onClick prop to the MyButton component.
Key Points:

Props are read-only in the child component. You cannot directly modify props within the child component.
Props are essential for building reusable and modular components in React.
By passing data through props, you create a clear and organized flow of information within your React application.
In simpler terms:

Imagine props as gifts that a parent component gives to its child component.
The child component uses these gifts to do its job.
The parent component decides what gifts to give, but the child component cannot change those gifts.


1. Children

What are Children?

In React, children refers to any content that is placed between the opening and closing tags of a component.
This can be:
Text: Simple text content.
Other Components: You can render other React components as children.
JSX: Any valid JSX expression.
Example:

JavaScript

function MyComponent({ title }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{title}</h1> 
      <p>This is some content.</p> 
    </div>
  );
}
In this example, the <h1> and <p> elements are considered "children" of the MyComponent.

2. Lists

Rendering Lists:

You often need to render a list of items (e.g., items in an array).
React provides a way to efficiently render lists using the map() method.
Example:

JavaScript

const items = ['item1', 'item2', 'item3'];

function MyList() {
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <li key={item}>{item}</li> 
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
3. Keys

Why are Keys Important?

When React renders a list, it needs to efficiently track which items have changed, been added, or removed.
Keys help React identify each item in the list uniquely.
Key Requirements:

Keys should be:
Unique: Each item in the list must have a unique key.
Stable: The key for a given item should not change over time.
Preferably from your data: If possible, use a unique identifier from your data source (e.g., an ID from your API).
Example:

JavaScript

const items = [
  { id: 1, name: 'item1' },
  { id: 2, name: 'item2' },
  { id: 3, name: 'item3' },
];

function MyList() {
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li> 
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
In simpler terms:

Children: The content that a component "holds" or "contains."
Lists: A way to efficiently render multiple items in React.
Keys: Unique identifiers for each item in a list, helping React track changes efficiently.





Routing in React

Routing is the mechanism that allows users to navigate through different parts of a web application without the need to reload the entire page. In React, this is typically achieved using the React Router library.

Key Concepts

Routes: These are mappings between specific URLs and the components that should be rendered for those URLs.
Router: The main component that provides the routing infrastructure for your application.
Link: A component that enables navigation within your application by creating anchor-like elements that maintain the application's state.
Basic Example

JavaScript

import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <nav>
        <Link to="/">Home</Link> | <Link to="/about">About</Link>
      </nav>

      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
}

function Home() {
  return <h1>Home Page</h1>;
}

function About() {
  return <h1>About Page</h1>;
}
In this example:

The BrowserRouter component provides the routing context for the application.
Routes is a container for all the defined routes.
Route components define specific routes, each with a path and an element (the component to render).
Link components create clickable navigation links that update the URL without reloading the page.
Key Features of React Router

Nested Routes: Create hierarchical structures within your application.
Dynamic Routing: Define routes with parameters (e.g., /users/:id) to handle dynamic URLs.
Redirects: Implement redirects to different routes based on conditions.
Navigation: Control navigation programmatically using the useNavigate hook.
Benefits of Using React Router

Single-Page Application (SPA) Experience: Provides a smooth, app-like experience for users.
Improved User Experience: Faster navigation and reduced page load times.
Maintainability: Organizes your application's structure and makes it easier to manage.
In Summary

React Router is a powerful library that simplifies the process of implementing client-side routing in React applications. It enables you to create dynamic and user-friendly web applications with a seamless navigation experience.
