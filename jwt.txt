JSON Web Token (JWT) is a JSON-based access token that is used to authenticate and authorize a user to access a protected resource. 
It is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. 
The token is digitally signed and contains a payload that can be verified and trusted.


To create a JWT, you need to follow these steps:
1. Create a header that specifies the algorithm used to sign the token.
2. Create a payload that contains the claims you want to include in the token.
3. Sign the token using the header, payload, and a secret key.
4. Send the token to the client, who can then use it to access protected resources.
5. Verify the token on the server by checking the signature and decoding the payload.
6. If the token is valid, grant the client access to the requested resource.
7. If the token is invalid, deny access to the resource.
8. Optionally, you can include an expiration time in the payload to limit the token's validity.
9. You can also include additional claims in the payload to provide more information about the user or the token itself.
10. Make sure to keep the secret key secure to prevent unauthorized access to your resources.


Overall, JSON Web Tokens are a secure and efficient way to authenticate and authorize users in web applications.


To encrypt the data we use JWT.sign() method and to decrypt the data we use JWT.verify() method.
JWT.sign() method takes 3 parameters: payload, secret key, and options.
    payload: The data we want to encrypt.
    secret key: The key used to encrypt the data.
    options: Additional options like the algorithm used to encrypt the data.
JWT.verify() method takes 3 parameters: token, secret key, and options.
    token: The encrypted data.
    secret key: The key used to decrypt the data.
    options: Additional options like the algorithm used to decrypt the data.
