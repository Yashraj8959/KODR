encryption is the process of converting data into a code to prevent unauthorized access.
decryption is the process of converting the code back into data.
plaintext is the original data before encryption.
ciphertext is the data after encryption.
decrypt text is the data after decryption.

hashing------------------------>
hashing is the process of converting data into a fixed-length string of characters.
hash function is a function that converts data into a fixed-length string of characters.
hash value is the fixed-length string of characters generated by the hash function.
hash algorithm is the algorithm used to generate the hash value.
hash collision is when two different inputs generate the same hash value.



Authorization----------------->
Authorization is the process of determining what a user or service is allowed to do.

validation--------------------->
